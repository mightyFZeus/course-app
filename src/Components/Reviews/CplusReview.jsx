            C++  is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne 
            Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".
             The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented,
              generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.[9]

                C++ was designed with an orientation toward system programming and embedded,
                resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency,
                 and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[10] C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[10] including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).[11]
